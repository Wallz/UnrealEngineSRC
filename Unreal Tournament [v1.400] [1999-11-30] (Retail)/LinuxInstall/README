UnrealTournament Linux Installation Notes

The general game release notes can be found in /Help/ReadMe.htm on 
this CD.  Please refer to them before you start to play, because there
is a lot of useful information!

Installation:

Please read through all of this information before you begin your
installation.  It will help you solve problems before they start!

First, make sure that you have a drive with enough free space.  Unreal
Tournament requires around 600 megabytes to install.  The install
program will show you the free space you have on the filesystem you
chose to install to.

DO NOT INSTALL THE GAME AS ROOT.  If you do, all of the installed files
will be owned by root and only the root user will be able to play the
game.  The installed game will have the same permissions as the user you
run the installer with.

Unreal Tournament currently uses a central configuration file located
in the System directory (UnrealTournament.ini).  Keyboard and user
configuration information is stored in User.ini.

Make sure you choose ONLY ONE configuration option.  Select Glide if you
have a 3dfx card or select Mesa if you have an OpenGL card.  You will
need to find the appropriate drivers and X servers for your card.

If you do not have a sound card, don't have /dev/dsp, or don't have kernel
sound support directly or through modules, start Unreal Tournament with
the -nosound option.

If you have difficulty running Unreal Tournament, send a bug report to
utlinuxbugs@epicgames.com.  Try to include a copy of your 
UnrealTournament.log file.

Sound Issues:

If sound is too loud, run a mixer program and turn down your main volume.
I've noticed that Linux usually starts with the MAIN volume way too
high.
