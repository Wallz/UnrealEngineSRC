Known issues
------------

1. When connecting to a network game through the "Join Game" menu, you 
absolutely need to select your connection speed, either "Lan",
"28K Internet", or "56K internet".  If you don't select your speed,
you will probably experience erratic performance.

2. While this version should improve Internet play, we have more work 
to do in this area before it's perfect...there will be several more 
patches.

3. This patch is missing the latest 3dfx Voodoo2 dual TMU support.
There are some bugs that need to be worked out there.
